/** Wraps a Transport to offer actor interfaces. The semantic is as follows: each connection
 *  corresponds a single handler actor which receives data from the connections as messages, and
 *  can send data thought the connection by sending messages to the ActorRef provided in its
 *  constructor. The life time of this handler actor is coupled with the life time of the
 *  connection. As a consequence, detecting when the connection is opened or closed, can be done by
 *  respectively overriding the preStart() and the postStop() methods. Closing the connection can
 *  be achieved by sending a PoisonPill to the handler actor. */
